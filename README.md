# Graph-Map-Analysis

## About

Graph Map Analysis or GRAMA in short is a tool fully-developed in Java that supports graph analysis and visualisation. This is an ongoing project that will be worked on to provide a
free and open-source solution for graph analysts. 

## Preview 

GRAMA is equipped with an interface developped using SWING integrating a display for graph visualisation purpose. This is GRAMA on work!

Disclaimer : The arrangement of nodes can sometime be quite confusing but we're definitely working on it :)

## Functionalities

This tool is capable in doing several functions resumed below :

1. Finding the shortest distance between two points

2. Comparing two nodes on several properties

3. Search a route that includes several nodes 

4. Listing neighbours at K-distance away from node source

5. Visualisation of graph using a variation of Fruchtermann - Reingold algorithm

## Getting started

Graph Map is an ANT project developped in Apache Netbeans. The installation can be done in a very few steps.

Git clone the project :  
```
https://github.com/wockehs001/Graph-Map-Analysis.git
````
Open the project in your IDE and run Frame.java file to launch the GRAMA interface. There is a ready-made file "graph.csv" for test and usage 
purpose.
